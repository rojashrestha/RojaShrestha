# 👋 Hi, I'm Roja Shrestha

I’m not just learning to code — I’m learning to express, to create, and to connect.  
A tech student with a soft spot for beauty, stories, and the unseen magic in ordinary days.

💄 I romanticize routines.  
💻 I write code, but also rewrite myself often.  
📸 I create content that reflects both mess and meaning.  
🔮 I believe in intuition just as much as intention.
